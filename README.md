# Targeting-System

Made in Java using Swing library for UI and Eclipse for debugging/testing

Generates random objects, then calculates each object's distance to the turret, and whether the object is in the range
of the turret or not.

The data is displayed in a JTable, and the user can customize how many objects to be generated, the size of the objects,
the range as well as the position of the turret

Add a simulation to the program, where the turret will automatically find the closest targets and shoot them with the range specified, until there are no more targets left.
